Digital Electronics and Microprocessors is a course divided in two parts: the first part consists on applying the learnt theory of digital circuits to design such hardware components in VHDL; the second part is about dealing with microprocessors.

For the hardware design chapters, VHDL is learnt from scratch, carrying out several experiments in Vivado using a Xilinx Zynq-7020 device integrated into a Digilent Pynq-Z1 prototyping board. These experiments include:
1. A digital watch shown in four 7-segment control drivers.
2. The light sequence of the knight rider.
3. A digital locker using Finite State Machines.
4. The final project: creating a Simon game (the board generates a certain sequence which the user then replicates).

The microprocessors chapter, on the other hand, teaches how to exploit the sequentiality of software. Complex flowgraphs representing real-life embedded systems are designed, learning how to use the main three algorithms:
1. Blockade
2. Pass through and restart
3. Interruptions
