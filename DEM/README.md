Digital Electronics and Microprocessors is a course divided in two parts: the first part consists on applying the learnt theory of digital circuits to design such hardware components in VHDL; the second part is about dealing with microprocessors.

For the hardware design chapters, VHDL is learnt from scratch, carrying out several experiments in Vivado using a Xilinx Zynq-7020 device integrated into a Digilent Pynq-Z1 prototyping board. 
The final project consists on creating a Simon game (the board generates a certain sequence which the user then replicates).
