In Design of Embedded Systems, a System-on-Programmable-Chip (SoPC) is created using Xilinx's commerical devices and tools. Concretely, we work with a Zynq-7020 device integrated into a Digilent Pynq-Z1 prototyping board. The Vivado IP integrator tool will be used to build a processor-based design, and embedded software will be programmed and debugged with the Vitis unified software platform.
