Digital Signal Processing is a widely-known course for every discipline inside electronic engineering. In this scenario, the focus is to implement digital filters in VHDL, which are proven to be much more robust. 

This time, however, the experiments are carried out in ISE instead of Vivado, with an older FPGA. More concretely, this robustness is due to the design of a sigma-delta converter block.

The same filter is tested for a parallel and a serial architecture. Afterwards, the filter efficiency is proven with an Oscillator to check how steep the cut-off frequency is.
