Embedded Processing Architectures is essentially a computer architecture course, though it has a broader scope towards new hardware architectures (e.g. RISC-V) rather than just the classical PC microcontroller.

The labs carried out in this subject work on:

1. gem5: a widely used simulator for computer architecture research to evaluate the impact of the memory hierarchy in the performance of single-core processor systems.
2. POSIX threads (Pthreads): one of the most extended Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for working on the thread-based programming model for shared memory systems.
3. Open Multi-Processing(OpenMP): one of the most extendedd compiler extensions to work on the shared-memory programming model for shared memory systems.
4. Message Passing Interface (MCI):   one of the most extended Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to work on the message passing programming model for distributed memory systems.
5. Open Computing Language (OpenCL): open standard that offers code portability across different heterogeneous parallel
computing platforms   to work on data-parallel programming models.
