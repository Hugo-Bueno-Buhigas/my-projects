High-Level Description of Systems is conceived to help conventional programmers to design hardware not at its best efficiency fairly well. Using Vivado HLS, C code is transformed into VHD code, to later analyze and improve its througput and latency with various techniques such as pipelining.

The main project consists on translating a Matlab image recognition code into hardware and compare the results (both time and precision).

Later, a second part of the project consists on replicating this algorithm in SystemC for a system-level design approach.
