The Internet of Things (IoT) is a very wide concept behind our vision of the future: smart homes, smart cities... smart stuff. Nevertheless, this idea may be too high-level to be used; thus, this subject focuses on the low-level part of IoT, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).

Using the "cookies", a special hardware characaterized by its ability to stick several PCBS one on top of another (self-developed by our lab, CEI-UPM) and together with the Operating System ContikiOS, this subject focuses on the communication protocols used to connect the nodes to each other using an Ad-hoc strategy. Later, a final project of forbidden room-entry detection is implemented and tested.
